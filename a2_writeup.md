# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
I had a lot of trouble solving for when there what a %. The different places that the % could be made it harder for me to solve. Additionally, the different lenghts that the source code could be maed solving that potion of the function difficult.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
When you use the match function,  it returns a list of the extracted values and those values could be assigned to different databases. The keywords found using the match function make it easier to determine which database the computer should take information from, and then return the information that corresponds to the keywords.
